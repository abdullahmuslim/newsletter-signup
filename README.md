## My process
- I took a quick glace at the [desktop design](design/desktop-design.jpg) and [mobile design](design/mobile-design.jpg) which shows the fluidity and simplicity of transitioning between viewport.
- I complete the markup in a way that make sense to me the most (using h1 for part that looks like the perfect entry point for the page).
- The CSS part is a breeze, I have mucn fun playing around and testing out new technics in cloning design.
- I divided each work to a functional part and robbed my hands with some Regex. Looks very basic to me, but I agree it worth the sweat.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- Using `box-sizing: border-box;` to remove the worry of width change due to spacing in the development phase.
- Realised font-weight includes *400i, 700i, ...*
